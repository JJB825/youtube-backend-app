Two ways of connecting database:
1. directly in index.js 
2. modularising it in separate folder called db and importing it in index.js

Database connection:
-> There can be errors or problems, always safe to wrap in try-catch block or resolve-reject promise
-> database connection always requires time, so use async await 

app.on() method for handling express app errors

Express App:
req.params: used to fetch data from url
req.body: used to fetch json or forms data

cookie-parser: middleware for handling cookies
cors: cross origin resource sharing
app.use() method for handling middlewares or configuration settings

cors: origin parameter defines the source which can make requests to server
* in origin means all sources(not recommended usually)

cookie parser is used to setup backend for receiving different data formats from different parts
used for accessing and setting user's browser's cookies

for handling data from url, (url uses special encoding for sending data)
extended: true allows for nested objects sending

nodejs provides an error class that helps us to handle api errors 
wwe can override those classes using inheritance in js to standardise error handling process
